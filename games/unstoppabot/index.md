Based on a 19th century novella, Flatland: Fallen Angle is a noir tale of revenge, political uprising, and breaking your enemies into tiny pieces! Set in a world of only two dimensions, the player takes on the role of a once-powerful polygon – now reduced to a lowly triangle – who will do whatever it takes to reclaim his stolen sides.
