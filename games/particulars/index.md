quotes:
  - quote: "I haven’t cried playing a video game before; it’s not like it’s a habit. But there’s something about the loneliness of being a down quark all alone in a subatomic space that really underlined the joy in finding an anti-down quark to combine with."

Particulars is a game based on the science of sub-atomic particle physics. You play as a quark, and have to navigate the forces of the sub-atomic world as they push and pull at you.

The game follows the story of a young physicist Alison, as she navigates the forces affecting her life.
