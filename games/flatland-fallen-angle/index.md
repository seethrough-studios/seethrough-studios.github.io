  - quote: "it’s atmospheric, smart and does a great job of the unusual melange of simple line-art, breathless Pac Man-esque outrunning of foes and a doomy, nuanced narrative."

Based on a 19th century novella, Flatland: Fallen Angle is a noir tale of revenge, political uprising, and breaking your enemies into tiny pieces! Set in a world of only two dimensions, the player takes on the role of a once-powerful polygon – now reduced to a lowly triangle – who will do whatever it takes to reclaim his stolen sides.
